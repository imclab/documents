    <p id="p-3" data-page="25403">This action proposes to amend Class E Airspace at Dayton, TN, as the Hardwick Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) has been decommissioned and new Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) have been developed at Mark Anton Airport. Also, Hardwick Field Airport has closed; therefore, the controlled airspace area would be removed. This proposal also would establish Class E Airspace at Cleveland Regional Jetport, Cleveland, TN, to accommodate area navigation (RNAV) global positioning system (GPS) SIAPs at the airport. Information regarding Bradley Memorial Hospital would be added to the Cleveland, TN, airspace description and removed from both the Dayton, TN, regulatory text as well as its listing as Bradley Memorial Hospital, Cleveland, TN, to correct an erroneous reference. This proposal would enhance the safety and airspace management of Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations in the Dayton, TN, and Cleveland, TN, airspace areas.</p>
