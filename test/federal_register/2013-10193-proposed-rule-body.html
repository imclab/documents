</h2></div>
<div class="body_column">
        <p id="p-15" data-page="25404">The FAA is considering an amendment to Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 71 to amend Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface within a 9.8-mile radius of Mark Anton Airport, Cleveland, TN, to support new Standard Instrument Approach Procedures developed at Mark Anton Airport. Airspace reconfiguration is necessary due to the decommissioning of the Hardwick NDB and cancellation of the NDB approach. Also, controlled airspace is no longer needed and would be removed from Hardwick Field Airport as the airport has closed. This proposal also would establish Class E airspace at Cleveland, TN, providing the controlled airspace required to support the RNAV (GPS) standard instrument approach procedures for Cleveland Regional Jetport. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface would be established within a 7.4-mile radius of the airport, with an extension from the radius to 12 miles southwest of the airport for the safety and management of IFR operations. Bradley Memorial Hospital information would be added to the Cleveland, TN descriptor and regulatory text, and removed from both the Dayton, TN, regulatory text as well as its listing as Bradley Memorial Hospital, Cleveland, TN, to correct an erroneous reference. This proposal would enhance the safety and airspace management of Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations in the Dayton, TN, and Cleveland, TN, airspace areas.</p>
        <p id="p-16" data-page="25404">Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9W, dated August 8, 2012, and effective September 15, 2012, which is incorporated by reference in <a class="cfr external" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/select-citation/2013/05/01/14-CFR-71.1">14 CFR 71.1</a>. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="25404">The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a “significant rule” under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a Regulatory Evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this proposed rule, when promulgated, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</p>
        <p id="p-18" data-page="25404">The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is found in Title 49 of the United States Code. Subtitle I, Section 106 describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's authority. This proposed rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, the FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace. This proposed regulation is within the scope of that authority as it would amend Class E airspace in the Dayton, TN, and Cleveland, TN, areas.</p>
        <p id="p-19" data-page="25404">This proposal would be subject to an environmental analysis in accordance with FAA Order 1050.1E, “Environmental Impacts: Policies and Procedures” prior to any FAA final regulatory action.</p>
