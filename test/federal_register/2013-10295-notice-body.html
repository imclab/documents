          <i class="E-03">Background:</i> The FAA has enacted policy to ensure that the majority of data from its systems is exchanged through approved external protected boundaries. This transition away from multiple direct connections to FAA systems will provide for the security and operational effectiveness of FAA systems and reduce the cost of developing and maintaining multiple interfaces needed to distribute data and information. To provide for the security and operational effectiveness of FAA systems and to reduce the cost of developing and maintaining multiple interfaces needed to distribute data and information, FAA is moving away from direct connections to systems for external users to an approved external protected boundary such as NAS Enterprise Secure Gateway (NESG). This transition will help FAA protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data/information, services, and to manage the cost of maintaining data and information services in the future. This policy supports the streamlining of the approval process for distribution of data/information to external entities and gives the FAA the ability to manage and secure its data and information assets more effectively.</p>
        <p id="p-18" data-page="25522">
          <i class="E-03">Proposed Policy:</i> To conform to current U.S. Government practices and policies and enhance information security, FAA is proposing to establish a policy for the distribution of data and information to external entities including the FAA's contractors and other governmental entities. The FAA will:</p>
        <p id="p-19" data-page="25522">1. Not allow external users to connect (physically/logically) to authoritative sources of data/information. FAA data/information distribution will only be distributed externally from FAA approved replicated sources.</p>
        <p id="p-20" data-page="25522">2. Make electronic data/information available on a non-exclusive basis to external users, subject to the limits imposed by the need to protect national/homeland security, individual privacy, safety, confidentiality, and other government requirements.</p>
        <p id="p-21" data-page="25522">3. Limit distribution to only that data/information products created for FAA purposes.</p>
        <p id="p-22" data-page="25522">4. Distribute readily available data/information without intentional delay, subject only to the limits imposed by resources (both current and prospective), contracts, technology, authority, regulation and data quality while protecting security, privacy, and confidentiality.</p>
        <p id="p-23" data-page="25522">5. Provide access to data/information over secure and controlled connections (logical) and in accordance with the most recent federal systems security standards including those issued by the National Security Agency, Department of Defense, and the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) standards.</p>
        <p id="p-24" data-page="25522">6. Consider cost and cost recovery in making FAA data/information available to external users.</p>
        <p id="p-25" data-page="25522">7. Consider requests for data and information that is not readily available if external users can and do bear the full cost of development, connection, transmission, processing, and maintenance.</p>
        <p id="p-26" data-page="25522">8. Not be responsible for the quality, accuracy or continued availability of the data and information once released. While the data distributed is accurate and timely for use by the FAA, we are not responsible for quality, continuity, or intended use of data for third parties.</p>
        <p id="p-27" data-page="25522">9. Define the extent to which FAA contractors can reuse FAA data in their custody or control.</p>
        <p id="p-28" data-page="25522">10. Apply this proposed policy requirement consistently and transparently.</p>
