## Documents

Tools, ideas, and maybe some light standards for working with US documents.

### At The Moment

There are lots of different legal documents, and lots of websites and applications that want to display or otherwise integrate them. There aren't many great reusable tools out there for working with them, in part because what standards exist tend to be optimized for precision, longevity, and authoring tools. It's very non-simple.

This repository is an attempt to capture efforts and experimentation to simplify this scene, and to link to other existing and useful efforts.
